<b>BlockMassacre</b><br>
====================<br><br>

Block Massacre is a 2D block puzzle game created by Guy McLean.<br>

==============================
In order to compile the game you must first install both the <a href=http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/>irrKlang</a> sound library to your machine, 
<br>and the <a href=http://www.freetype.org/download.html>Freetype</a> font library.<br><br>
Also ensure that you have OpenGL (ver 2.1 or later) running on your machine.<br>

=================================
After that, the aim is simple. Break the blocks. You know the drill by now! Swap the blocks to create a row or column or 3 adjascent colours.<br>
The more break you have as a chain, the higher your multiplier will be (Top Left). The higher your multiplier, more points you gain from each block broken.<br>
<br>
Left click to select a block initially.<br>
Left click one of the adjecent 4 blocks to swap with that block.<br>
Right click anywhere to cancel a selection<br>
When the game is finished, 'r' restarts the game and 'q' returns to the title menu.<br><br>
Oh! And 'p' pauses.<br>

===============================

The highscores screen and its functionality hasn't been implemented yet.<br><br>
When attempting to play the game from a created .exe file. Dont forget to copy the recquired .dll's into the .exe's directory (irrklang.dll, ikpmp3.dll, glut32.dll & and whichever freetype you have installed).<br>
You'll also need to copy and paste the "sprites" and "sounds" folders into that same directory as well. But don't worry, they're included in this Github branch.
